We want to blow it up, make a vacuum in Florida's organized crime space, and fill it with our own operation.\nSo we stole Mother's diary and tore out the part where she confesses to hating Jared Deegan's creepy ass and strange sex kinks. We left in the part where she admits Lauren is Jared's daughter, not Father's, as a divine conception. We're the divine intervention. Jared's death will reveal the whole family to be a sham, and the house of cards of the Tallahassee Mob will fall apart faster than Judas's bloodline."
