She thinks the best revenge is throwing Pyrex parties and stealing guests from my own soires. Years ago, when I first heard she was a Pyrex rep, I bought stock. Lots of it, with my faceless husband's immense wealth. I only hosted parties so that she would host them better, more aggressively, with determination and rage and competition. And everytime Allister threw a party, that stock value grew and grew and grew. Tonight, I'm going to dump all of it and bankrupt Pyrex. Then, I'm going to give it to the interest of whomever Allister loves the most, inspiring her love to spurn her and chase the money. I'm so glad we're all together again."
